                    span.txt-red-light  BEM
                    | - this allows me to make the html-code

                    | Also, to extend the standard features of html,

                    span.txt-red-light  JavaScript
                    | , we do not part with the first days of
                    | my entry into web development. From the very beginning,
                    | I was fascinated by how I could manipulate and modify the
                    | DOM tree with it, create a paralax effect, sliders,
                    | and the like, where CSS itself was already powerless.
                    | Then I made my life easier using
                    span.txt-red-light  Jquery
                    | , and studying asynchronous programming
                    | allowed me to better understand and start using
                    span.txt-red-light  Ajax
                    |  technology. But since requests to the DOM tree
                    | are too resource-intensive and already to create
                    | more complex and functional sites, such as
                    span.txt-red-light  SPA
                    |  applications, this is not enough, I gradually
                    | became more experienced in using the
                    span.txt-red-light  Angular.js
                    |  framework and partially affected
                    span.txt-red-light  Angular 2+
                    | . And when I met
                    span.txt-red-light  Vue.js
                    | , I realized that this is what I need and
                    | have been studying and working with
                    span.txt-red-light  Vue.js
                    |  for about a year now and used in practice working with
                    span.txt-red-light  axios
                    | ,
                    span.txt-red-light  vuex
                    | ,
                    span.txt-red-light  vuetify
                    | ,
                    span.txt-red-light  vuelidate
                    | ,
                    span.txt-red-light  i18n
                    | . Also, in addition to this, I own build experience
                    | from a project from scratch on
                    span.txt-red-light  Gulp.js
                    |  and on
                    span.txt-red-light  Webpack
                    | . And in order that it doesnâ€™t bother me much, I also
                    | sometimes, well, quite sometimes, I study and practice with
                    span.txt-red-light  Node.js
                    | , developing
                    span.txt-red-light  MEAN
                    |  and
                    span.txt-red-light  MEVN

                    span.txt-red-light  Firebase
                    |  applications. I also work directly with
                    span.txt-red-light  Git
                    |  and
