                  p.txt-large.txt-show-anim Hi, I'm Konstantin Abramov. I am a Frontend developer and at the moment my experience is 2+ years. With great desire, ambition, dedication, sense of style and creativity, I approach every project.

                    | For the markup, when writing html code, I use
                    | the methodology of
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  BEM
                    | - this allows me to make the html-code
                    | more extensible and create reusable interface components.
                    | Also, to extend the standard features of html,
                    | I actively use the
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold.txt-uppercase  pug
                    |  pre-processor and the code eventually looks more concise.
                    | Using the ready-made components and frame of the
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Bootstrap
                    |  framework allows me to make development even faster and adaptive.

                    | I love style and beauty, so writing
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  CSS
                    |  for me is always fascinating, and animating a
                    | static object gives me even more pleasure, so I
                    | get to know and develop skills in creating animations
                    | with pleasure. To extend CSS, I use the
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  SCSS preprocessor.
                    |  Deepening knowledge and empowering with CSS allows me
                    | to recreate almost any fantasy, and for a practical polygon
                    | to create a design using tools such as
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Adobe XD
                    | ,
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Illustrator

                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Photshop

                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Adobe After Effects
                    | , which allows me to predict and more clearly recreate
                    | the motion animation. And at the moment
                    | I work with
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  SVG

                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  JavaScript
                    | , we do not part with the first days of
                    | my entry into web development. From the very beginning,
                    | I was fascinated by how I could manipulate and modify the
                    | DOM tree with it, create a paralax effect, sliders,
                    | and the like, where CSS itself was already powerless.
                    | Then I made my life easier using
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Jquery
                    | , and studying asynchronous programming
                    | allowed me to better understand and start using
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Ajax
                    |  technology. But since requests to the DOM tree
                    | are too resource-intensive and already to create
                    | more complex and functional sites, such as
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  SPA
                    |  applications, this is not enough, I gradually
                    | became more experienced in using the
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Angular.js
                    |  framework and partially affected
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Angular 2+
                    | . And when I met
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Vue.js
                    | , I realized that this is what I need and
                    | have been studying and working with
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Vue.js
                    |  for about a year now and used in practice working with
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  axios
                    | ,
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  vuex
                    | ,
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  vuetify
                    | ,
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  vuelidate
                    | ,
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  i18n
                    | . Also, in addition to this, I own build experience
                    | from a project from scratch on
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Gulp.js
                    |  and on
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Webpack
                    | . And in order that it doesnâ€™t bother me much, I also
                    | sometimes, well, quite sometimes, I study and practice with
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Node.js
                    | , developing
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  MEAN
                    |  and
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  MEVN
                    |  applications, a bit of practice with
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Firebase
                    |  applications. I also work directly with
                    span.txt-red-light.txt-bold  Git
                    |  and
